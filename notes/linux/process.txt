kill processes:
kill  signal   pid
--------------------------------------------
kill  -15     [pid]  <-  sends  sigterm
kill          [pid]  <-  also sends sigterm
kill  -2      [pid]  <-  sends  sigint
kill  -1      [pid]  <-  sends  sighup
kill  -9      [pid]  <-  sends  sigkill

suspend process running in foreground:
ctrl-z


list jobs table:

bring process to foreground:
fg
fg [jobnum]
eg: fg %3 # get 3rd jobs

eg: fg %@ # get all jobs
